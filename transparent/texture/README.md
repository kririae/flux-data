<del>This environment texture uses equi-area format as provided by PBRT-v4, although
our render does not support equi-area, directly loading it gives a better result
than my hand-crafted texture, so I leave it here for future work on conversion
(or maybe equi-area support?)</del>

The converted texture is adopted from [RayDemo](https://github.com/sergcpp/RayDemo).
